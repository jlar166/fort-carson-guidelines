[{"id": "A001", "code": "A001", "title": "Guideline Key", "section": "General Guidelines", "start_page": 5, "end_page": 8, "content": "A001 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n \nDescription \nThe following guidelines have been developed and approved by the FCFD and EACH EMS in conjunction with a working \ngroup representing FCFD, EACH EMS, AMR, CSFD, SCRETAC, SECRETAC and P2PRETAC. The guidelines delineate the \nexpected standard of care and acts allowed for EMT, EMT‐IV and paramedic providers under local medical direction. \n \nColorado EMS Providers working in the prehospital setting are expected to adhere to the scope of practice established in \nColorado Department of Public Health and Environment, 6 CCR 1015‐3 CHAPTER TWO ‐ RULES PERTAINING TO EMS \nPRACTICE AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR OVERSIGHT. As a federal entity these guidelines may vary from Colorado Chapter Two \non a case by case basis. The working group utilizes these rules to establish guidelines to be used as guidelines for operation \nduring prehospital EMS calls. They are also intended to serve as guidelines to ensure that all personnel falling under our \nmedical direction are trained in proper prehospital patient care. \n \nUnderstanding communication challenges faced by many of southern Colorado’s EMS providers, medical director(s) may establish \nthe circumstances and methods by which an EMS provider obtains authorization to perform any medical act, skill or medication. \n \nWhere evidence‐based practice has been available, the medical director group has diligently evaluated the research \navailable and drafted guidelines that will assist EMS providers in providing the best possible patient care. Where evidence is \nlacking, we have relied on best practices, expert advice, and consensus to guide the development of the guideline or \nprocedure. Moving forward, these guidelines are to be reviewed on a six month basis and updated when necessary to \nreflect advances in the art and science pertaining to the care of acutely ill and injured patients. \n \nNo guideline can account for every clinical scenario encountered as EMS is performed in a stressful environment with time‐\ncritical decisions. No specific patient care matrix can be developed that will cover every type of injury, illness, and \ncomplicating circumstance that prehospital providers will encounter while providing on‐scene care. From time to time, it is \nexpected that circumstances will arise that are not covered within these guidelines. In such instances, providers should \nfunction within their scope of practice and use all available resources (including On‐Line Medical Consultation) to ensure \nthe best outcome supported by documented clinical reasoning and sound judgment. \n \nAlthough these new guidelines imply a specific sequence of actions and/or procedures, it may often be necessary to provide \ncare out of sequence from that described, if dictated by clinical circumstances. Remember that there is no substitute for \nsound clinical judgment. We encourage providers to search for more in‐depth knowledge and understanding of patient \nmanagement principles by accessing up‐to‐date textbooks, literature, and research materials and to seek out continuing \neducation opportunities related to the practice of prehospital medicine. \n \nBy moving the guidelines to an electronic format, it will be possible to immediately link directly to a referenced guideline, \nprocedure and/or medication by clicking on a hyperlink, which is in blue and underlined. The guidelines can still be printed \nfor reference guides; they just won’t be quite as easy to navigate, especially during a real‐time, decision‐making situation. \n \nThanks to everyone who has provided assistance in guideline development and review. Any project this complex and \ndetailed is prone to errors. Please review these guidelines carefully and route any potential errors, unclear directions, or \nsuggestions for improvement to your agency’s EMS Officer or medical director. \n \n \nFinally, and most importantly, we thank every one of you for your dedication and commitment every day to providing the \nbest, most compassionate prehospital medical care to the citizens of our respective communities. \n \nODUCTION\n\nA001 Revised: 5/11/2022 \nGuideline Key \nFor guidelines using an algorithm format, acts allowed for each provider certification level are identified by borders \naround the appropriate instruction boxes using the following color key: \n \nIndividual medication and procedure guidelines include a color‐coded box at the top, indicating whether a specific \nprovider level is allowed to administer the medication, if the medication can be administered as a standing order (SO), \nrequires base contact for a verbal order (VO), and requirements for any repeat doses. Anywhere there is a “NO” it is not \nallowed. \n \nProvider Level \n1st Dose \nRepeat Dose \nEMT \nNO \nNO \nEMT‐IV \nNO \nNO \nAEMT \nNO \nNO \nIntermediate‐99 \nVO \nVO \nParamedic \nSO \nSO \n \nMedications or procedures that are only allowed to be performed by agencies with a current State‐approved waiver to \nthe acts allowed are clearly marked and indicated with an asterisk*and outlined or written in BROWN. \n \nMedications and procedures will be CAPITILIZED, italicized, underlined and written in BLUE to signify a hyperlink. \n \n \n \n \n \nPediatric/Adult Guidelines \nFor the purposes of these guidelines, pediatric patients are defined as birth until patient’s weight based calculations equal \nthe adult dose, see GENERAL PEDIATRIC OVERVIEW. Pediatric specific information will be noted by PURPLE TEXT. Adult \nspecific information will be in ORANGE TEXT. \n \nGuideline Education and Training \nThe curriculum for initial EMS provider training may not cover some of the treatments, procedures, and medications \nincluded in these guidelines. The acts allowed by Colorado’s Chapter Two Rules are more extensive than those required to \nbe taught using the National EMS Scope of Practice model. \n \nTherefore, it is the responsibility of all EMS agencies and their Medical Directors to ensure that initial training, verification \nof competence, and maintenance of the skills falling outside traditional EMS education are documented for all agency \nproviders. This may be of additional importance when training and orienting new providers, providers moving to a higher \nlevel of certification, and providers new to Colorado, prior to allowing them to practice independently. \nTeaching points deemed sufficiently important to be included in algorithm‐based guidelines are located in grey‐filled \nboxes.\n\nA001a.Chapter 201a Revised: 05/01/2018 \n \nSKILL‐ Respiratory \nEMT \nEMT‐IV \nPARAMEDIC \nAirway – Supraglottic \nY \nY \nY \nAirway– Nasal Pharyngeal Airway \nY \nY \nY \nAirway – Oral Pharyngeal Airway \nY \nY \nY \nBVM \nY \nY \nY \nCarbon Monoxide Monitoring \nY \nY \nY \nChest Decompression – Needle \nN \nN \nY \nChest Tube Insertion \nN \nN \nN \nCPAP \nY \nY \nY \nPEEP \nY \nY \nY \nCricoid Pressure – Sellick’s Maneuver \nY \nY \nY \nCricothyroidotomy – Needle \nN \nN \nY \nCricothyroidotomy – Surgical \nN \nN \nY \nEnd Tidal CO2 Monitoring/Capnometry/Capnography \nY \nY \nY \nFlow Restrictive Oxygen Powered Ventilatory Device \nY \nY \nY \nGastric Decompression – NG/OG Tube Insertion \nN \nN \nY \nInspiratory Impedence Threshold Device \nY \nY \nY \nIntubation – Digital \nN \nN \nY \nIntubation – Bougie Style Introducer \nN \nN \nY \nIntubation – Medication Assisted (non‐paralytic) \nN \nN \nN \nIntubation – Medication Assisted (paralytics) (RSI)‐Only waivered \nN \nN \nY \nIntubation – Nasotracheal \nN \nN \nN \nIntubation – Orotracheal \nN \nN \nY \nExtubation \nN \nN \nY \nObstruction – Direct Laryngoscopy \nN \nN \nY \nOxygen Therapy – Nasal Cannula, Non‐rebreather/Simple/Venturi Face Mask, humidiers \nY \nY \nY \nPulse Oximetry \nY \nY \nY \nSuctioning – Tracheobronchial \nN \nN \nY \nSuctioning – Upper Airway \nY \nY \nY \nTrachestomy Maintenance – Airway management only \nY \nY \nY \nTrachestomy Maintenance – Includes replacement \nN \nN \nY \nVentilators – Automated (ATV)1 \nN \nN \nY \n \n \nSKILL‐ Cardiac \nEMT \nEMT‐IV \nPARAMEDIC \nCardiac Monitoring – Application of electrodes and data transmission \nY \nY \nY \nCardiac Monitoring – Rhythm and diagnostic EKG interpretation \nN \nN \nY \nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) \nY \nY \nY \nCardioversion – Electrical \nN \nN \nY \nCarotid Massage \nN \nN \nY \nDefibrillation – Automated/Semi‐Automated (AED) \nY \nY \nY \nDefibrillation – Manual \nN \nN \nY \nMechanical CPR Device \nY \nY \nY \nTranscutaneous Pacing \nN \nN \nY\n\nA001a.Chapter 201a Revised: 05/01/2018 \n \nSKILL‐Immobilization/Wound care \nEMT \nEMT‐IV \nPARAMEDIC \nSpinal Immobilization – Cervical Collar \nY \nY \nY \nSpinal Immobilization – Long Board \nY \nY \nY \nSpinal Immobilization – Manual Stabilization \nY \nY \nY \nSpinal Immobilization – Seated Patient \nY \nY \nY \nSplinting – Manual \nY \nY \nY \nSplinting – Rigid \nY \nY \nY \nSplinting – Soft \nY \nY \nY \nSplinting – Traction \nY \nY \nY \nSplinting – Vacuum \nY \nY \nY \nExternal Pelvic Compression \nY \nY \nY \nHemorrhage Control – Direct Pressure \nY \nY \nY \nHemorrhage Control – Pressure Point \nY \nY \nY \nHemorrhage Control – Tourniquet \nY \nY \nY \n \n \nSKILL‐ Access/Fluids \nEMT \nEMT‐IV \nPARAMEDIC \nCrystalloids (D5W, LR, NS) – Initiation/Maintenance \nN \nY \nY \nIntraosseous – Initiation \nN \nN \nY \nIntraosseous Initiation – In Extremis \nN \nY \nY \nPeripheral – Excluding External Jugular – Initiation \nN \nY \nY \nPeripheral – Including External Jugular – Initiation \nN \nN \nY \nCentral Venous Catheter Maintenance/Patency/Use \nN \nN \nY \nUse of Peripheral indwelling Catheter for IV medications (Does not \ninclude PICC) \nN \nY \nY \n \n \n \n \nSKILL‐Miscellaneous \nEMT \nEMT‐IV \nPARAMEDIC \nAssisted Delivery \nY \nY \nY \nCapillary Blood Sampling \nY \nY \nY \nDiagnostic Interpretation – Blood Glucose 3 \nY \nY \nY \nDressing/Bandaging \nY \nY \nY \nEye Irrigation Noninvasive \nY \nY \nY \nEye Irrigation Morgan Lens \nN \nN \nY \nPhysical examination \nY \nY \nY \nRestraints ‐ Verbal \nY \nY \nY \nRestraints ‐ Physical \nY \nY \nY \nRestraints – Sedation \nN \nN \nY \nUrinary Catheterization – Maintenance \nY \nY \nY \nVenous Blood Sampling ‐ Obtaining \nN \nY \nY"}, {"id": "A002", "code": "A002", "title": "well as documentation.", "section": "General Guidelines", "start_page": 9, "end_page": 9, "content": "A002 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n \nDescription \na.

A person has appropriate decision making capacity if he or she; \n \nIs alert, oriented, reliable, calm, and cooperative AND \n \nIs able to understand the nature and consequences of his or her illness or injury AND \n \nIs able to understand the nature and consequences of the proposed or refused treatment AND \n \nNo IMPAIRED JUDGEMENT: Can make reasoned and rational decisions (based on provider discretion). \ni. Including the ability to repeat back to you the information discussed and weigh the \nrisks/benefits of refusing care. \nb. The patient should be assessed to determine that they are oriented, have an understanding of what happened, \nwhat may possibly happen if treated or not treated, and have a plan of action –such as how to get home from \nscene if refusing treatment. \n \nIf the patient does not have appropriate decision making capacity under these guidelines, consent should \nbe obtained from another responsible party (Must also have appropriate decision making capacity and be \nlegally \"of age\", spouse, adult son or daughter, parent, adult brother or sister, or legal guardian.) \nc. \nIf the patient does not have appropriate mental capacity and none of the above persons can be reached, the \nperson should be treated and transported to a medical facility. It is preferable to enlist support of law \nenforcement. \nConsent \na. A patient has the right to consent to or to refuse treatment. If the patient does not have decision making capacity, \na relative or guardian has this same right (see below). \n \nAge of consent varies with different states. In general, the patient must be over 18 years of age or \nbetween 15 and 18 years and \"emancipated,\" (i.e., living apart from his or her parents). \n \nEmancipated Juvenile per Title 19 section 19‐2‐511 of the Colorado Revised Statutes is anyone > 15 and \n< 18 years of age who has, with the real or apparent consent of the juvenile's parents, demonstrated \nindependence from the juvenile's parents matters of care, custody, and earnings. The term may include, \nbut shall not be limited to, any such juvenile who has the sole responsibility for the juvenile's own \nsupport, who is married, or who is in the military. \nb. Consent is \"implied\" when the patient is unable to consent to treatment due to age, mental status, or medical \ncondition AND no responsible party is available to grant that consent. \nc. \nIn no event should legal consent procedures be allowed to delay immediately required treatment. \n \nIf the time delay to obtain lawful consent from an authorized person would present a serious risk of \ndeath or serious impairment of health, or would prolong severe pain or suffering of the patient, \ntreatment may be undertaken to avoid that risk. \nd. If the patient is a minor, consent should be from a competent biologic parent, adopted parent, or legal guardian. \n \nThis includes school systems where loco parentis exist which allows teachers and other responsible adults \nto act on behalf of the student when the parent is not available. \ne. Involuntary Consent: a person other than the patient in rare circumstances may authorize consent. \n \nThis may include a court order (guardianship), authorization by a law enforcement officer for prisoners in \ncustody or detention, or for persons under a mental health hold or commitment who are a danger to \nthemselves or others or are gravely disabled. \nSpecial Considerations \na. It is preferred to render care in “good faith” which may help reduce the risk of legal consequence for failure to \ntreat and/or negligence. Do not let fear of legal consequences prevent rendering care. \nb. The best defense against any legal question of consent, decision making capacity, and the need for care, is a good \nprehospital care report that shows adherence to the standards of care and conveys competence. \nc. \nA medical provider with no previously established professional relationship with the patient has no medical \nauthority to direct care on scene.

All patients will require a minimum amount of supportive care and assessment; while some will require a more \nadvanced assessment and care. This guideline is designed to lay out the minimum requirements for BLS and ALS \ncare with some situational specifics. \n \nAssessment \na. A complete patient assessment is critical for identifying injuries or illness. It helps to create a working diagnosis \nthat will guide treatment decisions by the healthcare provider. It involves five steps: scene evaluation, primary \nassessment, medical interview, secondary assessment, and reassessment. \n \nVital Signs \na. In most medical settings, the standard vital signs are as follow: pulse rate, SpO2, respiratory rate, blood pressure, \nand body temperature/condition. In some instances, along with base vital signs, patient assessment can be \nexpanded to evaluate EtCO2, blood glucose, EKG (including 12 lead when clinically indicated), lung sounds, \nGlasgow Coma Scale (when clinically indicated), capillary refill, and/or pupils. The EMS provider is responsible for \nrecognizing when to expand the needed vital signs to help ensure a comprehensive assessment. \n \nIf time allows, acquire multiple sets of vitals to identify trends. At least 2 sets on transported patients. \n \nUnstable patients SHOULD have vital signs assessed every 5 minutes \n \nb.

Monitor vital signs en route. \nc. \nMake sure to document the following: \n \nDocument observer’s impression of the infant’s color, respirations and muscle tone \n \nWas the child apneic, or cyanotic or limp during event? \n \nWas there seizure‐like activity noted? \n \nWas any resuscitation attempted or required, or did event resolve spontaneously? \n \nHow long did the event last? \n \nSpecial Considerations \na. For pediatrics, reference Pediatric Field Guide, Broselow Tape, Handtevy Guide, or approved apps \nb. Airways are smaller, softer, and easier to obstruct or collapse \nc. \nRespiratory reserve is small. Minor insults such as improper positioning, emesis, stomach filled with air, or airway \nnarrowing can lead to major problems. \nd. Circulatory reserve is also small. The loss of one unit of blood is sufficient to account for severe shock or death in \nan infant. Conversely, 500 mL of unnecessary fluid can result in acute pulmonary edema. \ne.

A paramedic should attend the \npatient for all code 3 returns other than those that are system status. \n \nSpecific Destination Guidelines \n \na. A paramedic may make the decision to transport the patient back to the hospital emergently based on his or her \nown evaluation of the situation. When this occurs, clear and thorough documentation must be present so that a \nfull understanding of why the code 3 return was necessary is apparent to anyone reviewing the PCR. \nb. Code 3 returns based on mechanism of injury alone are not indicated. Patients who have stable vital signs and no \nsignificant injury should be transported code 2 regardless of the mechanism warranting the call to 911. If the \npatient begins to “crash” enroute to the hospital, then an upgrade in transport status is indicated. \nc. \nCode 3 returns based on illness should be evaluated as to whether we can fix the problem in the pre‐hospital \nsetting. If we can treat the illness or injury and resolve the issue before leaving the scene, we should make every \nattempt to do so. If attempts are made but the condition persists, then a code 3 return may be necessary. If the \ncondition is stabilized because of our intervention, a code 3 return may not be required. \nd. Concussion with or without a loss of consciousness including repetitive questioning is not, in and of itself, criteria \nfor a code 3 return. \n \nCode 3 Indications \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYES \nTransport Code 2 \nNO \nDOES THE PATIENT HAVE THE ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING? \n1) Penetrating injuries to head, neck, or torso? \n2) AMI, as evidenced by 12 lead ECG \n3) Acute CVA with known onset of ≤ 12 hrs? \n4) Advanced airway intervention (intubation) \n5) Acute and severe respiratory distress not adequately responding to treatment? \n6) Closed head injury with signs of neurological compromise? \n7) Cardiac Arrest? \n8) The paramedic determines the patient condition warrants a Code 3 return? \nTransport Code 3 \n**All Other Patients** \n Any patient not meeting the above two sets of criteria may be transported per normal operating procedures, i.e. personal \npreference, closest, etc. \n \nYES\n\nA015.Intoxicated Non‐Transport16 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n \nDescription \na. To establish a procedure for defining and processing calls that result in the intoxicated patient not being \ntransported so that the patient, the provider, the provider’s agency and the Medical Director are all protected \nfrom liability. \nb. For EMS administrators, the most problematic patients are sometimes those who do not want an ambulance at \nall. \n \nEMS providers who transport a patient involuntarily may face allegations of assault or false \nimprisonment. Conversely, those who leave a patient behind, may, be accused of negligence. \n \nThese allegations can become even more prevalent when the patient is under the influence of alcohol. \nc. \nThis protocol serves as a way for street providers to balance the needs of the system, with the needs of the \npatients, while still giving themselves, their agency, and their medical director adequate protection from possible \nliability. \n \nCompetence \na. U.S. courts have long upheld the right of well‐informed, mentally competent adults to accept or refuse medical \ntreatment as they see fit. However, this right of refusal is by no means absolute. \n \nIn a medical emergency, EMTs and paramedics may force a patient rendered mentally incompetent by \nillness, injury, or intoxication to accept life‐saving care, no matter how strongly the patient objects. \n \nOur challenge is to define the circumstances under which a patient should be presumed incompetent. \nb. It is a well‐known fact that due to the publicity surrounding the 9‐1‐1 system as well as the availability of \ncellular phones, emergency calls for service – for the UNINJURED intoxicated person have become an almost \ndaily occurrence. \n \nProcessing an Intoxicated, Uninjured, Patient \na. Responder‐initiated non‐transport, is approved for INTOXICATED parties only when the following conditions have \nbeen satisfied: \n \nThe intoxicated party does not wish transportation to a medical facility \n \nThe intoxicated party denies any current (acute) signs or symptoms \n \nUpon examination of patient – the highest trained or senior medical provider on scene determines there \nis no acute medical or traumatic illness or injury \n \nUpon completion of a full set of vital signs (BP, RR, HR, SpO2) \n \nUpon examination of all elements of the call (such as inclement weather and patient location) the highest \ntrained or senior medical provider on scene determines that the patient is in no immediate risk of illness \nor injury \n \nThere is a responsible, sober adult willing to take responsibility for the safety of the intoxicated patient \nSpecial Considerations \nb. Non‐transport situations continue to be the biggest liability risk.

All patients receiving pain medication should receive constant ECG, SpO2, EtCO2 and blood pressure \nmonitoring. When this is not possible (i.e., in a back country environment), pulse oximetry and constant \nverbal engagement with the patient are the minimum monitoring requirements. \n \nOther Medication Options \na. \nThe administration of a combination of benzodiazepines and opiates, for the purpose of pain \nmanagement with associated anxiety is permitted. \n• \nEnsure that the patient can independently maintain an open airway and normal breathing \npattern, maintain normal hemodynamics, respond appropriately to physical stimulation \nand verbal commands. \nb. Consider an antiemetic if the patient develops nausea or vomiting or has a history of nausea with \nopiates. \nSpecial Considerations \na. \nIn trauma pain is secondary, look for major bleeding or life threats first.

Purpose \n \nA patient that is being treated at one medical facility and requires ground transportation to another \nmedical facility should not suffer from a change in the standard of care during transport. The orderly \ntransfer of patients between medical facilities is provided for under the INTERHOSPITAL TRANSFER \nprotocol. This addendum is meant to allow for the maintenance of certain intravenous infusions and \ndevices during the course of the transfer. \n \nIt is not possible to foresee all possible interventions that a patient may be undergoing at the time of such \na transfer, however, the following considerations should be kept in mind: \n \nThe overall status of the patient should direct the resources that are used for the transfer. If the patient is \ncritically ill or injured, a nurse, paramedic or physician that is familiar with the patient should accompany \nyou during transport. If the patient “crashes” it is worth having an extra pair of hands available. \ni. In the presence of a medication, procedure or device that is new to the patient (and that you \nare unfamiliar with), you should have a nurse or physician that is familiar with the patient \naccompany you during transport. \nii. In the presence of a medication, procedure or device that is not new to the patient you may \nattend the patient without assistance if: \n1. No complications are anticipated, and; \n2. You can be familiarized with the medication, procedure or device before departure \nfrom the sending facility, and; \n3. Written orders from the sending physician are obtained or \n4. The patient is used to controlling the medication, procedure or device on their own, are \ncurrently capable of doing so, and the continuation of such has been approved by the \nphysician who is attending to the patient. \niii. When in doubt, ask for help. Contact the base hospital physician with any concerns BEFORE you \nencounter problems, if at all possible. \n \nb. General Procedures \n \n The following apply to each of the medications covered in this protocol. \ni. Administration of these medications may not be initiated by EACH paramedics, unless covered \nelsewhere in the protocols. \nii. If the medication is to be infused via an infusion pump, you must be familiar with the operation \nof that particular pump or have a nurse accompany the patient during transport. \niii. You are responsible for the patency of the intravenous line. \niv. Know the concentration of the drug solution and follow the infusion rate that was ordered by \nthe treating physician. \nv. Document the concentration, the infusion rate, and the total infusion amount in the prehospital \nreport. \nvi. If infiltration occurs during infusion, discontinue immediately and contact the base hospital \nphysician. \nvii. If any adverse reactions occur during infusion, discontinue immediately and contact the base \nhospital physician. \nviii. If you feel that you require assistance during transport, get assistance.\n\nI003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \nc. \nApproved for Paramedic Level Transport \n \nMedications \nSkills \nActivated Charcoal \nMagnesium sulfate \nChest tube monitoring \nAdenosine \nMannitol \nVentilators (ATV) \n \nRestricted to \nmanipulation \nof tidal volume, \nrespiratory \nrate, FiO2, and \nPeep ONLY \nAlbuterol/Xopenex \nMethylprednisolone \nAmiodarone \nMetoclopramide \nAntibiotics \nMetaproterenol \nAspirin \nMidazolam \nAtropine \nMorphine \nBenzocaine spray \nNarcan \nBlood products \nNerve agent antidotes \n \nBumetanide \nNicardipine \n \nCalcium \nNitroglycerin \n \nColloids \nNitrous oxide \n \nCrystalloids \nOctreotide \n \nCyanide antidote \nOlanzapine \n \nDexamethasone \nOndansetron \n \nDiazepam \nOver‐the‐counter medications \n \nDiltiazem \nOxytocin \n \nDiphenhydramine \nPantoprazole \n \nDopamine \nPotassium \n \nDroperidol \nPralidoxime \n \nEpinephrine \nPromethazine \n \nFentanyl \nRacemic epinephrine \n \nFurosemide \nRocuronium(MAAM waivered paramedics only) \n \nGlucagon \nSodium bicarbonate \n \nGlycoprotein inhibitors \nTerbutaline \n \nHaloperidol \nTetracaine \n \nHeparin \nThiamine \n \nHydrocortisone \nTopical hemostatic agent \n \nHydromorphone \nTPN \n \nInsulin \nVasopressin \n \nIpratropium \nVecuronium (MAAM waivered paramedics only) \n \nIV dextrose \nVerapamil \n \nKetamine (pain/sedation) \nZiprasidone \n \nLidocaine \nAny medication authorized in guidelines \n \nLorazepam \n \n \nLow molecular weight \nheparin\n\nI003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \nd.

HEPARIN \n \nIndications: Intravenous heparin is frequently administered as an anticoagulant to prevent clotting in the \nsetting of ischemic coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, or peripheral vascular conditions. \n \nMechanism of Action: inhibits the mechanisms of blood clotting and formation of fibrin clots by \ninactivation of activated Factor X and inhibition of prothrombin’s conversion to thrombin \n \nContraindications: Severe thrombocytopenia and active bleeding \n \nComplications: Hemorrhage from any site may occur, as well as, hypersensitivity signs and symptoms. \nHypotension may also occur during infusion. If any complication occurs during infusion, discontinue \ninfusing the medication and contact base hospital physician. \n \nProcedure: Usually 20,000 or 40,000 units of heparin are added to 1,000 cc of normal saline. The \nadministration is dependent upon the patient’s weight. The usual infusion is 12‐18 units/kg/hr \ndepending on the indications. Maintain the infusion rate that was ordered by the treating physician. \n \nb. NITROGLYCERIN \n \nIndications: Nitroglycerin administration results in smooth muscle relaxation and consequential \ndilatation of peripheral arteries and veins. These results in pooling of blood decreased left ventricular \nend‐diastolic wedge pressure (preload), and coronary artery dilatation. These mechanisms are useful in \ntreating ischemic coronary states and hypertension. \n \nMechanism of Action: causes vasodilation that relieves tension on vascular smooth muscle and dilates \nperipheral veins and arteries \n \nContraindications: Hypotension and shock may occur with even small amounts of nitroglycerin. Because \nof absorption of nitrates into plastic, the amount of drug exiting the IV tubing may be much less than the \namount entering the tubing. There is no simple correction factor. The patient should be observed \nclinically for pain relief, blood pressure changes and signs of poor perfusion. The infusion rate should be \nadjusted accordingly, with Base Hospital approval. \n \nProcedure: \ni. Nitroglycerin is a concentrated drug that should be administered after dilution. Usual mixtures \ninclude 25‐50 mg in 500 cc of D5W or NS. This yields a solution of 50‐100 mcg / ml. \nii. Discontinue the infusion and contact the Base Hospital physician if signs of poor perfusion \n(pallor, sweating, prolonged capillary refill, or decreased mental alertness) occur, or with systolic \nblood pressure less than 100 mmHg. \niii. Infusion rates may be increased, only through direct contact with the Base Hospital physician, \nshould the patient experience worsening ischemic chest pain or hypertension.\n\nI003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \nc. \nANTIBIOTICS \n \nIndications: Antibiotics may be given IV in serious or life‐ threatening infections to rapidly achieve high \nblood levels of the drug for maximum bacterial killing power. \n \nContraindications: In general, the treating physician will have considered the contraindications to \nadministration before the infusion is started. You should, however, review the patients’ previous allergy \nhistory. If a patient gives a history of an allergic reaction to the drug, the infusion should be discontinued \nand the Base Hospital should be notified immediately. \n \nComplications: If allergic signs or symptoms develop (e.g., itching, rash, difficulty breathing, wheezing, \nhypotension, etc.) discontinue the infusion immediately and notify the Base Hospital. Treat allergic \nreactions per protocol. Occasionally, local irritation at the IV site may develop. Discontinue the infusion \nand notify the Base Hospital if any complications occur. \n \nd. BLOOD and BLOOD PRODUCTS \n \nIndications: Blood or blood products administered intravenously may be lifesaving in hemorrhagic shock, \ncertain anemic states, and other hematological disorders. The treating physician will have considered the \nindications prior to initiating the infusion. In general, you will be continuing the infusion of platelets or \nfresh‐frozen plasma for certain bleeding disorders. \n \nContraindications: The treating physician will have considered the contraindications to blood transfusion. \nSome patients may object to the transfusion of blood products for religious reasons (i.e., Jehovah’s \nWitness). For problems, contact the Base Hospital. \n \nComplications: Transfusion reactions and hypersensitivity reactions can occur after the onset of blood \nproduct infusion. Symptoms may include restlessness, anxiety, flushing, chest or lumbar pain, \ntachycardia, tachypnea, nausea, and shock. Occasionally bleeding from coagulopathy may develop. If \nany of the signs or symptoms listed above develop after the initiation of the transfusion, the transfusion \nshould be immediately discontinued and the Base Hospital contacted for instructions. Shock, if present, \nshould be treated according to protocol. \n \nProcedure: \ni. Maintain infusion rates as indicated by the treating physician. \nii. All blood products should be administered through tubing with a filter. \niii. Document blood product number (with pen or sticker) to the permanent medical record and the \ntrip sheet left at the receiving hospital. \n \ne. SOLUMEDROL / METHYLPREDNISOLONE \n \nIndications: Methylprednisolone is a potent anti‐inflammatory steroid that is used for a wide variety of \nconditions. Most frequently, you will encounter respiratory patients that have been placed on this \nmedication for acute exacerbations of their chronic disease process. Occasionally, patients with \nneurologic sequelae secondary to a spinal cord injury will be placed on this medication in the hopes of \npreventing further injury to the cord by spinal edema. \n \nMechanism of Action: A highly potent steroid with greater anti‐inflammatory activity than prednisolone \nand lesser tendency to induce sodium and water retention. \n \nContraindications: Premature infants and patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug. \n \nPrecautions: Rare instances of bronchospasm, bradycardia, and other cardiac arrhythmias have been \nreported after large, rapid doses of intravenous methylprednisolone. \n \nProcedures: Maintain the infusion as it was directed by the treating physician. \n \nf. \nVITAMINS / TPN / ELECTROLYTES \n \nIndications: Intravenous vitamins or electrolytes may be infused when there is confirmed or suspected \ndeficiencies that require correction.\n\nI003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n \nContraindications: These will have been previously considered by the treating physician. \n \nPrecautions: None with vitamins. Potassium (K+) should be given at the prescribed rate (usually no \nfaster than 10 mg/hr). Infusion of intravenous potassium solutions may precipitate cardiac conduction \nabnormalities. All patients being given intravenous potassium must be on a cardiac monitor. The \ninfusion rate must be watched very closely. \n \nProcedure: Maintain at prescribed rate with patient on a cardiac monitor (for potassium supplements). \nInfusion rate should be slowed if any burning or irritation occurs at the infusion site. Discontinue the \ninfusion and contact the Base Hospital immediately if any complications, including arrhythmias, occur. \n \ng. INSULIN \n \nIndications: Insulin, a hormone that is normally produced by the pancreas, is required by the body for \neffective transport of glucose across cell membranes. Relative or absolute deficiencies in insulin can \nresult in hyperglycemia, non‐ketotic hyperosmolar coma, or diabetic ketoacidosis. \n \nMechanism of Action: Regulation of glucose metabolism by stimulating cellular uptake of glucose and \ninhibits glucose output from the liver \n \nContraindications: Hypoglycemia or known allergy to naturally occurring (pork or beef products) \nproducts. \n \nComplications: The most frequent complication of exogenous insulin administration is hypoglycemia \nwhich may manifest by such symptoms as sweating, dizziness, restlessness, headache, anxiety, irritability, \nabnormal behavior, unsteady gait, slurred speech, blurred vision, personality changes, disorientation, \nunconsciousness, or seizures. Allergic reactions can produce swelling, itching, redness, hives, \nhypotension, diaphoresis, wheezing, difficulty breathing, or dysphagia. If any of these complications \noccur during infusion contact the Base Hospital and discontinue the infusion immediately. \n \nProcedure: \ni. The most common insulin drip is composed of Regular Humulin. The insulin drip should be \nprepared by the sending institution. A typical concentration is 50 units in 250 cc of NS (0.2 \nunits/ml). \nii. Maintain drip rate as established by the treating physician. A typical loading dose for DKA is 0.1 \nunits/kg, followed by an infusion of 0.1 units/ kg/hr Monitor patient’s blood sugar during initial \nphase of transport and at least every 30 minutes thereafter. \niii. In the setting of a patient with a beta blocker overdose this could be significantly higher dosing. \niv. Monitor the patient for any changes in neurologic status or hemodynamic instability. \n \nh. OCTREOTIDE \n \nIndications: Esophageal Varices. \n \nContraindications: Sensitivity to medication. \n \nPrecautions: Not compatible with TPN, diazepam, or phenytoin. Severe hypoglycemia in diabetic \npatients. Prolonged QT syndrome. \n \nProcedure: Maintain drip at rate prescribed by physician. \n \nI. \nPANTROPRAZOLE \n \nIndications: Erosive esophagitis. \n \nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to medication. \n \nMechanism of Action: Proton pump inhibitor that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production and \nleads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion \n \nPrecautions: Do not co‐administer with other medications in the IV line. Dizziness and headache may be \nanticipated side effects \n \nProcedure: Maintain drip rate as prescribed. Do not give IV push.\n\nI003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n \nJ. \nGLYCOPROTEIN INHIBITORS \n \nIndications: Acute coronary syndromes and PCI. \n \nContraindications: These will have been previously considered by the treating physician. \n \nPrecautions: Observe for any signs of bleeding, including intracranial. \n \nProcedure: Hypotension or signs of intracranial bleeding occur, immediately stop the infusion and \ncontact medical control. \n \nk. \nNICARDIPINE \n \nIndications: Angina. Hypertensive crisis. \n \nMechanism of Action: Calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions \ninto the myocardium and selectively into coronary vascular smooth muscles without altering serum \ncalcium concentrations \n \nContraindications: Atrial fibrillation and flutter associated with accessory bypass tracts. High‐degree AV \nheart blocks (AVHB). Hypotension. Bradycardia. Cardiogenic shock. \n \nPrecautions: Confusion, slurred speech, somnolence, hypotension, syncope, and bradycardia are all \npotential serious side effects of this medication. \n \nProcedure: Maintain at prescribed rate with patient on a cardiac monitor. Monitor blood pressure \nclosely. \n \nl. \nOXYTOCIN \n \nIndications: Control of post‐partum bleeding. (NOTE ‐ If oxytocin is being used to induce labor, the \npatient should be accompanied by obstetrical personnel.) \n \nMechanism of Action: Promotes uterine contractions by increasing intracellular concentrations of calcium \nin uterine myometrial tissue \n \nContraindications: These will have been previously considered by the treating physician. \n \nPrecautions: Tachycardia, PVC’s, hypotension and vomiting may be seen as side effects of this \nmedication. \n \nProcedure: Maintain at prescribed rate in liter of normal saline. Consider second IV placement for fluid \nresuscitation purposes. \n \nl. \nMAGNESIUM \n \nIndications: (1) Tocolysis (often in conjunction with Beta‐agonist therapy), and (2) treatment of \npreeclampsia/eclampsia. \n \nMechanism of Action: Exact mechanism unknown. Speculated that magnesium may decrease myometrial \ncontractility \n \nContraindications: These will have been previously considered by the treating physician. \n \nPrecautions: Apnea, AV Block, Cardiac arrest and pulmonary edema may be seen as side effects of this \nmedication. \n \nProcedure: Maintain at prescribed rate in liter of normal saline. Obtain baseline DTR’s and periodically \nre‐evaluate throughout transport (Note: diminished DTR’s tend to precede respiratory depression and \nAVHB). Consider second IV placement for fluid resuscitation and medication administration purposes. \nCalcium (under direct physician direction) may be utilized to reverse toxic effects of magnesium. \n \nl. \nAMIODARONE \n Indications: Control of ventricular arrhythmias. Intravenous form of medication may occasionally be \nused for the control of atrial fibrillation.\n\nI003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n Mechanism of Action: Antiarrhythmic with predominant class III effects of lengthening cardiac action \npotential and blocking myocardial potassium channels lead to slowed conduction and prolonged \nrefractoriness. Also has sodium channel blockade, antisympathetic action and negative inotropy in nodal \ntissue. \n Contraindications: Cardiogenic shock. Symptomatic bradyarrhythmias. \n Precautions: Amiodarone may have significant proarrhythmic effects. These may be more pronounced in \npatients on other antiarrhythmic medications and antibiotic medications. Use in children and infants \nrequires a pediatric specialty team for transport. \n Procedure: Careful cardiac and hemodynamic monitoring is essential. Be particularly aware of \nprolonging QTc intervals as a harbinger of multiform ventricular tachycardia. Typical IV loading dose is \n 150 mg over 10 minutes. Maintenance drip is 0.5‐1 mg/min. Follow physician’s administration orders \nthroughout transport. \n \nm. LIDOCAINE \n Indications: Control of ventricular arrhythmias \n Mechanism of Action: Antiarrhythmic that blocks sodium channels \n Contraindications: These will have been previously considered by the treating physician. \n Precautions: Cardiac arrhythmias due to proarrhythmic effects. Neurologic‐oriented side effects \n(including seizures) with overdosage. Discontinue infusion if patient becomes symptomatically \nbradycardic or develops AVHB. \n Procedure: Maintain prescribed dosage regimen throughout transport. Typical drip rates range from 2‐4 \nmg/min. \n \nn. KETAMINE \n Indications: Sedation, Pain \n Mechanism of Action: Rapid acting general anesthetic that produces analgesia \n Contraindications: These will have been previously considered by the treating physician. \n Precautions: Continuous cardiovascular monitoring. Hypertension and tachycardia are common side \neffects, however bradycardia and hypotension can occur. \n Procedure: Maintain prescribed dosage regimen throughout transport. Typical drip rates range from 0.1‐\n0.5mg/min. \n \no.

This document is designed to provide Emergency Medical Services (EMS) practitioners with guidance regarding the \noutbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID‐19) that began in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December \n2019. This guidance serves as a reference for general considerations and the protection of responders. For a more \ncomprehensive list of EMS and PSAP recommendations, consult the 2.10.2020 interim guidance document at the \nfollowing link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k6ut0mw4rIGf3xr3f433xolmDwtkeqww \nb. *NO ETT INTUBATION (iGel ONLY) FOR ANY RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH SUSPECTED COVID PATIENTS* \nc. \nFor updates and additional information regarding this COVID‐19 outbreak, please visit the following web pages: \n \nCDPHE: https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/2019‐novel‐coronavirus \n \nCDC: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019‐ncov/index.html \n \nNote that this information is changing rapidly and you should go back to recheck these resources \nregularly. \n \nDispatch \na. High risk travel list of countries has been updated to include China, Iran, Italy, Japan, and South Korea. This list has \nbeen added to the supplemental Emerging Infectious Disease Surveillance tool for the following complaint \ncategories: Sick Person and Breathing problems. Also, high risk patients include those with close contact with a \nlaboratory confirmed COVID19 patient or Person Under Investigation (PUI) within 14 days of symptom onset of \nfever and respiratory illness. As the community spread increases and travel history becomes less indicatory of risk, \nthe travel question will likely fall off.\n\nK003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n \nOperational Infectious Control \na. Due to emergence of sustained community transmission in other parts of the continental United States we have \nupgraded respiratory droplet/airborne isolation precautions to include ALL of the following complaint categories \nregardless of travel history: Sick person and Breathing Problems. \nb. Required PPE for providers in DIRECT contact of presumptive COVID‐19 patients: Goggles (not glasses), disposable \nexam gloves, disposable gown, fit tested N95 or higher respiratory precaution. We expect the guidance to change \nto include coveralls as an alternative to gowns given the nature of ambulance work. Surgical masks should be \nplaced on the patient as soon as possible. \nc. \nProviders should maintain a minimum of 6ft of distance from presumptive COVID‐19 patients until providers donn \nrequired PPE. If patients can follow commands, surgical masks may be thrown to the patients for self application. \nOtherwise, apply surgical mask on patient after donning PPE. In most cases only one to two providers with full PPE \nshould contact the patient outside if possible and load the patient to the ambulance. \nd. If required for extrication additional providers may be utilized with full PPE however exposure should be limited to \nthe time necessary to extricate and load the patient to the ambulance. Drivers, if they have direct patient contact, \nshould donn required PPE. After completing patient care and before entering an isolated driver’s compartment, \nthe driver should remove PPE and perform hand hygiene. A respirator SHOULD continue to be used during \ntransport. \n \nUnit Preparation Prior to Transport \na. All exposed items that will not be used within the patient compartment need to be stowed in an outside \ncompartment or protected position. \nb. Any exposed item will need to be thoroughly decontaminated after transport otherwise. Drivers compartment \nshould be isolated from patient compartment using sliding doors, window, or plastic sheeting. \nc. \nAmbulance exhaust fans should be used and air recycling setting on ambulance air conditioners should not be \nused. \n \nAerosol Generating Procedures (AGP’s) \na. \n1 High risk countries are those with community transmission of COVID‐19. These countries are list on CDC’s travel \nwebsite. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019‐ncov/travelers/index.html \nb. Any AGP’s should be reserved for patients presenting in respiratory failure only. All other routine uses of AGP’s will \nbe suspended for presumptive COVID‐19 cases. This includes suctioning, intubation, and nebulized medications. \nc. \nIf an AGP must be utilized it should be done in the back of the ambulance before transport with the HVAC system \noperating and all doors to the patient compartment fully opened to maximize airflow. \n \nTransport Infectious Control \na. Patient is required to have a surgical mask in place prior to transport and attending provider must be in full PPE. \nProviders in the patient compartment will be limited to essential personnel to minimize possible exposures. \nb. All non‐essential loose items in the ambulance should be stowed or they will need to be decontaminated. The \nlaptop SHOULD NOT BE used in the back of the ambulance during transport of a presumptive COVID‐19 case as this \nhas been identified as a significant risk factor for secondary transmissions. \nc. \nThe laptop should remain in the front of the units and all documentation should be done after the patient has \nbeen transferred and the unit has been completely decontaminated. \nd. Family members and other contacts of COVID‐19 PUI patients should not ride in the transport vehicle.\n\nK003 Revised: 5/11/2022 \n \nReceiving Hospital Notification \na. Please notify the receiving hospital of a presumed positive case by providing them with the following information: \nrespiratory/breathing symptoms and severity, known travel status to affected area, specific area and time of \ntravel, close/direct exposure to someone with travel history to affected area and specific area and time of travel if \nknown. \n \nPost Transport Decontamination of Units \na. After transporting the patient, leave the rear doors of the transport vehicle open to allow time for sufficient air \nchanges to remove potentially infectious particles. All personnel involved in active decontamination must don full \nsuggested PPE or remain in initial PPE from the transport while conducting decontamination of the unit. Follow all \nnormal decontamination protocols for cleaning and disinfecting the vehicle. All surfaces that may have come in \ncontact with the patient or materials contaminated during patient care (e.g., stretcher, rails, control panels, floors, \nmonitor, walls, work surfaces) should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected using an EPA‐registered hospital \ngrade disinfectant in accordance with the product label. Clean and disinfect reusable patient‐care equipment \nbefore use on another patient, according to manufacturer’s instructions. \nb. After decontamination procedures all PPE should be doffed in the ambulance bay area and bagged for disposal. \nNormal disposal procedures can be utilized. EMS documentation should include a listing of EMS clinicians and \npublic safety providers involved in the response and level of contact with the patient (for example, no contact with \npatient, provided direct patient care) and the PPE used during patient care. \n \nInterim Infectious Exposure Guidance \na. An infectious exposure to COVID‐19 will be defined as an unprotected (NO PPE) direct exposure to a known or \npresumed COVID‐19 case OR a semi‐protected (incomplete PPE) sustained exposure to a severely ill known or \npresumed COVID‐19 case involving an AGP. These are the only two scenarios as outlined by the CDC at this time. \nb. If you believe you have had an infectious exposure, follow the normal protocol and dispatch the designated \ninfection control officer/EMS Chief for response and communication with County Public Health/CDPHE for \nguidance on monitoring or quarantine of exposed individuals based on elements of the exposure. \n \nCommunity Surveillance Testing of Patients \na. You may be asked by the Local or State Public Health Agency to obtain nasal/oral swab testing of members of your \ncommunity for COVID19 surveillance. There has been emergency expansion of scope of practice for all EMS \ncertification levels (EMT to Paramedic) to perform these nasal/swab testing of suspected cases of COVID 19 while \nwearing required PPE as above at the direction of the local or state public health agency. Training for the nasal/oral \nswabs must be performed prior to performing the test which can be found along with other EMS guidance \ndocuments at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k6ut0mw4rIGf3xr3f433xolmDwtkeqww \n \nUpdate Information: 3/5/2020 \na. Information about COVID 19 is continuously evolving, and in light of the outbreak at the LifeCare facility in \nWashington where 30 firefighters and first responders were quarantined and some developed illness increases \nawareness of potential spread without a travel history. To clarify, the following are recommended for full PPE use: \n \nFever and respiratory illness OR \n \nContact with a Person Under Investigation (PUI) or confirmed COVID‐19 infected person with fever and \nrespiratory illness \nb. Patients WITHOUT fever and respiratory symptoms dispatched as Sick persons and breathing problems would not \nneed mandatory PPE precautions unless the provider discovers COVID19 risk factors on scene (travel, known PUI \nor COVID 19 exposure, fever and cough/respiratory illness)."}]
